					<p class="list-group-item-text">A sister competition to the Chess League in which the aggregate ratings total for the team cannot exceed 550 (using ECF ratings).

			<p>During the season (September through to May), the Club meets on <b>Mondays at 7-30pm</b> here for a few games, and prospective members are welcome to visit the Club as our guest and play a few games with Club members. The Club caters for players of all strengths and we are always looking for chess enthusiasts to join us.</p>

			<p>We are currently organising a <b>Junior</b> section of the Club; if you are interested, do not hesitate to contact us here.</p>
